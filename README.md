## Overview

I completed this for the [Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024). This commit represents **stage 1** of the course. The objective is to convert [this static webpage](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) to a responsive, mobile-ready web application which is in compliance with accepted accessibility standards and functional during limited or no internet connectivity.

### Requirements

* Development requires both [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). In a terminal, run these to install:
  * Grunt: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * Gulp: `npm install -g gulp-cli`

### Setup

* Clone this repo to your machine.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `npm install`.
* Run `grunt` to build the responsive images.

### Development
* Run `gulp` in the project directory. The page should automatically launch in your default browser. Modifying the `html`, `js` and `scss` files should cause the page to refresh automatically.
